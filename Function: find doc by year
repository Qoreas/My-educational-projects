/*
Meow! Write a program getDocumentsNumbers that will return the number of documents for a given year.

The function should have two parameters: an array with the names of the documents and the year for which the documents should be found.
Parameter names can be anything. The dates in the array are written as strings.

The function should return the number of documents whose title contains the required year.

If there are no such documents in the array, the function should return 0.

    if (year > -1) {
      count++;
