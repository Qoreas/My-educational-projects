/*
Meow! I need a program that will calculate the usefulness and performance of players based on their statistics. 
Write the code as a getStatistics function with one parameter - an array of players.

Each player in this array is described by an object with three fields: name (name property), goals scored (goals property), and assisted passes (passes property).

The function should return the same array, in which two more fields are added for each player:
Keksu® utility coefficient (coefficient property) and efficiency (percent property).

The utility factor is calculated as follows: we multiply the player's goals by 2 (because I believe that goals are the most important) and 
add to this value all the assists of the player.

We consider the performance (the percentage of goals scored by a football player from the result of the whole team) as follows: 
we find the sum of the goals of all players and find out how many percent of this number each football player scored. Round the value with Math.round.
*/

let getStatistics = function (players) {
  let totalGoals = 0;
  
  // calculate coifficient and total goals
  for (let i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
    let currentPlayer = players[i];
    currentPlayer.coefficient = currentPlayer.goals * 2 + currentPlayer.passes;
    totalGoals += currentPlayer.goals;  
  }
  
  //check value
  console.log(totalGoals);
  
  // calculate goals percent each player
  for (let j = 0; j < players.length; j++) {
    let currentPlayer = players[j];
    let result = (currentPlayer.goals * 100) / totalGoals;
    currentPlayer.percent = Math.round(result);
  }
  
  return players;
};

let array = [{"name":"Васька","goals":5,"passes":5},{"name":"Байт","goals":12,"passes":2},{"name":"Снежок","goals":2,"passes":7}];
getStatistics(array)
