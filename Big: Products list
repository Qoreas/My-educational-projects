The result should be a string with array inheritance separated by commas like 'element, element, element'.

Each element must be separated by a comma, a period at the end of the line is not needed. And remember about spaces before all words except the first.

Elements must be added to the mass sequentially, falling into the very first element of the array, dissolving in the vessels.

An array with food purchases into a variable.

Record the string with the storage of purchases in the shoppingList variable.
