/* 
Meow! I need a program that from the "dirty" salary 
(salary before taxes) will calculate the approximate "clean" salary (which is issued to the paws).

Design the program as a function calculateSalary with one parameter — the value of the dirty salary. 
The function must return the net salary.

I don’t need much precision, we just assume that 35% of the dirty salary is taxes, 
and if the dirty salary is greater than or equal to 100 thousand, then taxes are already 45%.
