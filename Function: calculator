/*
Meow! Write a calculate function that will recognize user input, perform mathematical operations, and return the result.

The function's parameters are firstNumber, secondNumber, and operator.

Parameters firstNumber, secondNumber are operands, operator parameter is an operator.

All values come as strings, including operators. The third parameter contains one of the operators: 
addition ('+'), subtraction ('-'), multiplication ('*'), division ('/').

Depending on the operator, the program must perform different operations: add the first number to the second, 
subtract the second from the first, multiply the first by the second, divide the first by the second.
*/

let calculate = function (firstNumber, secondNumber, operator) {
  let result;
  firstNumber = Number(firstNumber);
  secondNumber = Number(secondNumber);
  
  if (operator === '+') {
    result = firstNumber + secondNumber;
  }
  
  if (operator === '-') {
    result = firstNumber - secondNumber;
  }
  
  if (operator === '*') {
    result = firstNumber * secondNumber;
  }
  
  if (operator === '/') {
    result = firstNumber / secondNumber;
  }
  
  return result;
