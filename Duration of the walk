First, if it rains, the walk cannot take place. In this case, the duration of the walk should be 0.

Secondly, if the temperature is too low (below 0°C) or too high (above 35°C), the walk will not take place either.

at 19°C or 21°C, the duration will be 19 minutes, at 18°C or 22°C, 18 minutes, and so on.
