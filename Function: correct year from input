/*
Meow! Write a getYears program that will return an array of eligible dates for the Olympics.

The function must take three parameters as input. The first parameter is the year from which you want to start counting (inclusive).
The second is the year in which this countdown must end (inclusive). The third is a number that represents the sum of the digits in the year number.

The years in the array must be numbers and must be in ascending order, from smallest to largest.
