Meow! Write a program that will analyze my daily diet.

Make the program look like a getDiet function. It should take two parameters: 
an array with the calorie content of dishes and a daily calorie limit. Parameter names can be anything.

The program should return the number of dishes from the array that I can eat and not exceed the allowed calories.
The dishes will be eaten in order, starting with the first element in the array.

let getDiet = function (calories, caloriesLimit) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < calories.length; i++) {
    total += calories[i];
    if (total > caloriesLimit) {
      return i;
    }
  }
};


let array = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70];

getDiet(array, 50);
