First, the calculation always starts on Monday. This is the first day.

Secondly, I take protein every third day:
1 day, Monday - no,
Day 2, Tuesday - no,
Day 3, Wednesday - yes,
Day 4, Thursday - no,
Day 5, Friday - no,
Day 6, Saturday - yes,
Day 7, Sunday - no,
Day 8, Monday - no,
Day 9, Tuesday - yes
and so on.

Fourth, it is known how much protein I eat on weekdays and how much on weekends.

Fourthly, the period starts with an increase in the number, from one to infinity (although I usually do not build plans for more than a month).

The program should return the total amount of protein in the period, the total amount of protein in the variable.
