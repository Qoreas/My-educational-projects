The cost is stored in the price variable.

If the purchase price is between 1000 (inclusive) and 3000 (excluding this value), the discount is 5%.

If the purchase price is from 3000 (inclusive) to 5000 (not including this value), 10% discount.

If the purchase price is from 5000 (inclusive) and above, a 15% discount.

In other cases, there is no discount for buyers.

Calculate the cost including the discount and write the result to a variable
discountedPrice.
