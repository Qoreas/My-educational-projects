/*
Meow! Add the configurator for me. I built a house object and set several properties: 
rooms (number of rooms), floors (floors), material (material for walls), factor (average area of each room).

I also started a materialPrice map, which shows the cost of each possible material for construction.

Add two methods to the object: calculateSquare, which will return the area of the house, and calculatePrice, which will return the construction cost.

Consider the area as follows: multiply the number of rooms by the coefficient and the number of floors in the house.

The price of construction is the product of the area and the cost of the material of the house.

let materialPrice = {
  'wood': 1000,
  'stone': 1500,
  'brick': 2000
};

let house = {
  rooms: 10,
  floors: 5,
  material: 'wood',
  coefficient: 10.5,
  
  calculateSquare: function () {
    return this.rooms * this.floors * this.coefficient;
  },
  
  calculatePrice: function () {
    return this.calculateSquare() * materialPrice[this.material];
  },
  
};

console.log(house.calculatePrice());
