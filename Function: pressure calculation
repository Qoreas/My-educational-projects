/*
Meow! Write a function calculatePressure that will calculate the pressure at depth and return this value from the function.

The calculation formula is: pressure = liquid density * free fall acceleration * depth.

calculatePressure must have two parameters: fluid density and depth. Parameter names can be anything.

Free fall acceleration is not required. In the formula, you can use the average fixed value - 9.8.
*/

let calculatePressure = function (density, depth) {
  let pressure = Math.round(density * 9.8 * depth);
  return pressure;
};
