/*
Meow! Write a program to calculate the cost of a project.

Name the function getPrice. It should have two parameters:

- time (in hours) to be spent on the project;
- a boolean value that indicates the urgency of the project - true for an urgent order and false for a regular one.

Parameter names can be anything.

For each project there is a fixed rate - 1500 rubles per hour. The calculation of the cost of projects looks like this: time * rate per hour.

There are several nuances. If the project is urgent, then the hours are reduced by half, and the rate per hour is increased by 2.5 times.

And if the project time is more than 150 hours, the rate per hour is reduced by 250 rubles.

Check the urgency first. The function must return the cost of the project.

let getPrice = function (time, isExpress) {
  let pricePerHour = 1500;
  let total = 0;
  
  if (isExpress) {
    time = time / 2;
    pricePerHour *= 2.5;
  }
  
  if (time > 150) {
    pricePerHour -= 250;
  }
  
  total = time * pricePerHour; 
  return total;
};

getPrice(60, true);
