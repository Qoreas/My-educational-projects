/*
Meow! Write a program to determine the type of transport in a bicycle parking lot.

Make the decision in the form of a checkVehicle function with two parameters: the number of wheels of the vehicle and the weight of this vehicle. Parameter names can be anything.

If there are two wheels and the weight of the vehicle is less than 100 kg, it is a bicycle. The function should return the string 'Parking allowed'.

Otherwise, the function should return the string 'You don't belong here! Meow!'.

    result = 'Parking allowed';
  } else {
    result = 'You don't belong here! Meow!';
  }
